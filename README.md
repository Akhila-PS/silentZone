## Basic Details

**Project Description:**  
Silent Zone is a mobile application that automatically switches your phone to Do Not Disturb (DND) mode when you enter a predefined location. You can set this location either as your current GPS position or by selecting a point on an interactive map. Once activated, the app quietly monitors your location and silences all notifications when you enter the silent zone, restoring normal mode when you leave.

**Features:**
- Real-time distance calculation and display
- Inside/outside zone status with distance (e.g., "INSIDE silent zone (45.2m away)")
- Clear/delete zone functionality
- Location naming system ("Current Location", "Map Selected Location")
- 100-meter radius detection zone

**It’s perfect for:**
- Meetings
- Classes
- Libraries
- Any environment where you need peace — without lifting a finger.

## The Problem (that doesn't exist)

People forget to press the Do Not Disturb button exactly at the right GPS coordinate.

The world is too noisy, and our thumbs are too tired to tap one icon.

The split-second delay between entering a meeting and silencing the phone is ruining productivity worldwide.

Manual silencing has become an outdated, prehistoric ritual in the smartphone era.

People need a dramatic, overengineered solution for the simple act of pressing one button.

## The Solution (that nobody asked for)

A hyper-intelligent app that stalks your GPS location like a clingy ex.

Automatically slams your phone into Do Not Disturb mode the moment you step into your “silent zone.”

Lifts the silence the instant you escape — because freedom matters.

Eliminates the need for that exhausting, finger-cramping tap on the DND button.

Turns a 2-second manual task into a cutting-edge location-based automation masterpiece.
