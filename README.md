Project Description
[Fridge Whisperer Ammachi is an interactive web app that analyzes your fridge contents through image upload and suggests personalized recipes. Using AI-powered ingredient detection with YOLOv8 on the backend, it offers fun, mood-based dialogues from Ammachi, the virtual grandma. The frontend features a charming UI and dynamic speech bubbles that respond to user moods. This project combines computer vision, natural language, and playful UX to make cooking inspiration delightful and accessible.]

The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[- People forget to press the Do Not Disturb button exactly at the right GPS coordinate.  
- The world is too noisy, and our thumbs are too tired to tap one icon.  
- That split-second delay between entering a meeting and silencing the phone is ruining productivity worldwide.  
- Manual silencing has become an outdated, prehistoric ritual in the smartphone era.  
- We need a dramatic, overengineered solution for the simple act of pressing one button.]

The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[- A hyper-intelligent app that tracks your GPS location like a clingy ex.  
- Automatically slams your phone into Do Not Disturb mode the moment you step into your ‚Äúsilent zone.‚Äù  
- Lifts the silence the instant you escape ‚Äî because freedom matters.  
- Eliminates the need for that exhausting, finger-cramping tap on the DND button.  
- Turns a 2-second manual task into a cutting-edge location-based automation masterpiece.]
